# 3D-renderer
This is a small education project I took in hand to learn more about 3D rendering while following an online tutorial.

## What it does?

Basically, it just spins 3 cubes on screen at a relatively constant framerate. Like this:

## How does it work?

It has spatial points that make up polygons which in turn make up 3D shapes. In a render/update cycle, a point manager is able to move all points based on
translate and rotate functions.



## Where did you learn this?

Youtube user https://www.youtube.com/user/12whattup created the wonderfull tutorial where you too can learn how to create a 3D java renderer.
It's really fun and the way the tutorial is structured is awesome, check it out!
